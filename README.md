# Chess 3

Hi, I am a UCI compatible chess engine. I'm the third chess engine my author has written, thus the really unimaginative name, following the first two programs [chess2](https://github.com/paulsonkoly/chess-2) and [chess](https://github.com/paulsonkoly/chess).

Currently I'm using chess-2's [lichess account](http://lichess.org/@/chess-2-bot).
