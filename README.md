# Chess 3

chess-3 is a [UCI](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI)-compatible chess [engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_engine). It is a successor of [chess2](https://github.com/paulsonkoly/chess-2) and [chess](https://github.com/paulsonkoly/chess).

chess-3 is a standalone command-line chess engine. It does **not** include a graphical interface, chess server, networking, or multiplayer support. It is designed to be used via a UCI-compatible chess GUI or tournament manager.

chess-3 can be used in most of the chess GUIs, such as [Arena](https://www.playwitharena.de/), [BanksiaGUI](https://banksiagui.com/), [CuteChess](https://cutechess.com/), [PyChess](https://github.com/pychess/pychess) etc.

chess-3 is occasionally online on Lichess using chess-2's [Lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/chess-2-bot).
